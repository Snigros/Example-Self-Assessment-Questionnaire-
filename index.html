							Section 22(8) of the <i>Public Service Act 1999</i> states that:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							An Agency Head must not engage, as an APS employee, a person who is not an Australian citizen,
							unless the Agency Head considers it appropriate to do so.
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							Consistent with this requirement, the Chief Executive Officer of our organisation has determined that
							is not appropriate for non-Australian citizens to be employed within the our organisation.

					</div>
				</section>

				<!-- Not over 18 -->
				<section id="S12">
					<h3>Recommendation</h3>
					<p>
						As a general rule, you must be at least 18 years old to be eligible for employment with our organisation.
					</p>

					<p>
						However if you at least 15 years old, and currently completing an Australian School-based Apprenticeship, you may
						also be eligible.
					</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Ethics -->
				<section id="S13">
					<h3>Recommendation</h3>
					<p>
						Our employees must demonstrate and adhere to the highest standards of integrity and ethical
						behaviour - both on, and off, duty.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you feel that you are unable to meet this requirement, you may not be suitable for employment with the our organisation.
					</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Jail -->
				<section id="S14">
					<h3>Recommendation</h3>
					<p>
						Our employees must demonstrate respect for the law, and a commitment to upholding and enforcing
						the law.
					</p>
					<p>
						A criminal conviction does not prevent you from being employed by our organisation - particularly if you have been
						convicted of a minor matter, or have a conviction which occurred a long time ago.  However, if you have
						a significant or extensive criminal history, you may not be suitable for employment with our organisation.
					</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Criminal Associations -->
				<section id="S15">
					<h3>Recommendation</h3>
					<p>
						As a law enforcement agency, it is not appropriate for, nor does our organisation tolerate, associations between our
						officers and criminality. These relationships are fundamentally inconsistent with our role, mission and values.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you knowingly and actively associate (except in the course of your official duties) with criminals or
						persons who may be involved in criminal activity, you may not be suitable for employment with our organisation.
					</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Drug Associations-->
				<section id="S16">
					<h3>Recommendation</h3>
					<p>
						Our organisation has a 'zero tolerance' policy in relation to any officers using, possessing or selling illicit
						substances (prohibited drugs).  This activity is fundamentally inconsistent with our role, mission and values.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have consumed prohibited drugs in the past, this does not prevent you from being employed by our organisation -
						particularly if the use was minor or it occurred a long time ago.  However, if you currently use prohibited
						drugs, or have a significant or extensive history of drug use, you may not be suitable for employment with our organisation.
					</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Pornography -->
				<section id="S17">
					<h3>Recommendation</h3>
					<p>
						Our agency is one of those charged with protecting the most vulnerable individuals within our society.
					</p>
					<p>
						Accessing child exploitation material is a serious crime and is fundamentally inconsistent with
						our role, mission and values.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have ever viewed, downloaded, accessed or purchased child pornography,
						you may not be suitable for employment with our organisation.
					</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Illegal Goods -->
				<section id="S18">
					<h3>Recommendation</h3>
					<p>
						Our employees must demonstrate respect for the law,
						and a commitment to upholding and enforcing the law.  Involvement in, or association with, unlawful
						activity is fundamentally inconsistent with our role, mission and values.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are or have been (except in the course of your official duties) involved in, or associated with
						the production, sale, manufacture or distribution of illegal goods, you may not be suitable for employment
						with our organisation.
					</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Traffic Offences -->
				<section id="S19">
					<h3>Recommendation</h3>
					<p>
						Our employees must demonstrate respect for the law, and a commitment to upholding and enforcing the law.
					</p>
					<p>
						Receiving a speeding fine or other traffic infringement does not prevent you from being employed by our organisation -
						particularly where the infringement(s) may have been minor, committed without intent, or may have occurred a
						long time ago.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, if you have a significant or extensive history of serious driving offences or
						traffic infringements, you may not be suitable for employment with our organisation.
					</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Possibly violent -->
				<section id="S20">
					<h3>Recommendation</h3>
					<p>
						Our employees must demonstrate and adhere to the highest standards of integrity and ethical
						behaviour - both on, and off, duty.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are currently the subject of an Apprehended Violence Order, Restraining
						Order or other similar order, you may not be suitable for employment with our organisation.
					</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Recommend Apply -->
				<section id="S21">
					<h3>Recommendation</h3>
					<p>
						Thank you for completing the our organisation character and integrity suitability
						self-assessment.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you completed this self-assessment truthfully and did not receive any
						adverse recommendations or advice, there does not appear to be anything in your
						background from a character and integrity perspective which may automatically prevent
						you from being employed by our organisation. We encourage you to apply for positions of
						interest as they become available.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please remember that if you do apply for a career with our organisation you must be open and
						honest in the information you provide, as a failure to do so may impact adversely on
						an assessment of your suitability for employment with our organisation.
